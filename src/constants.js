  pc: `This is my PC. I mostly work with JavaScript and Python these days.
    I’ve built several full-stack web applications and love working on meaningful tech projects. Programming for me is more than just writing code—it's about solving real-world problems.
    Feel free to explore my <a href="https://github.com/suhaib-md" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!`,
  
  "cs-degree": `This is my IT degree. It represents a solid foundation in computer science and problem-solving. 
    The journey wasn't easy, but it taught me how to think like an engineer.`,
  
  "sofa-table": `That’s my sofa. I relax here after long coding sessions, often watching tech videos or brainstorming new project ideas. 
    I also enjoy sharing what I learn—maybe someday you’ll find me on YouTube too!`,

  tv: `That's my TV. I use it to catch up on tech content. Some of my favorite creators include ThePrimeagen, Theo (t3.gg), PirateSoftware, and Melkey.
    They share a lot of practical insights and motivation for developers like me.`,

    Whether it's frontend, backend, or full-stack work—I enjoy building great user experiences.`,

  library: `These are some of my tech books. I’ve read a few, skimmed many, and collected even more.
    I also speak multiple languages—including a bit of Hindi and Arabic. Who else hoards programming books for “someday”?`,
